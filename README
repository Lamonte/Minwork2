===================
CHANGES 10/15/2011
===================

- Updated Minwork Class so action functions are called via the 'action_' prefix 
	Allow me to make public functions without actually being accessed from the url
	came across this issue when making the callback method to my formhandler library.
	(All methods must be updated now)
	
- Made README = CHANGELOGS for now on ill update this with things I change/update/fix
- FormHandler library now has callbacks so you can use custom function checks from the
	controller.  Instead of using built in callbacks.  Mainly useful like database
	checks when needed and possibly other updates.
	
------
	
- Updated FormHandler.php library changed quotations on the rules because of the output.
	Ex: 'Input field $1 is empty!', to "Input field '$1' is empty!",
	
------

- After attempting to put code on server made all class names lower cased.
- Removed mysql database_abstract class because it was useless, unnecessary
- Weird issue calling the route function from the index.php so I created a new instance
	and put it into a variable
	
===================
CHANGES 10/16/2011

	$_GET and $_POST.  Made variables passed as references to fix the issue and shortened the
	code a bit.
